# Phishing-Scam-Detector-Analysis
Created by: Mia O'Halloran, Nicholas Dias, Jiayi Shen, Kaylee Dong

Python analysis of whether a phishing scam can be detected by it's URL contents. Used supervised machine learning (K Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest Classifiers) to classify URLS as non-phishing or phishing based on certain features. Analyzed dataset using t-tests, and correlations as well as visualizing data through graphs such as random forests feature importance, percentage bar chart, box plot, correlation scatter plots, histograms and violin plots.

Conclusion:
From our machine learning models, random forest classifier was a moderate predictor of phishing or non phishing URLs, but the KNN model was a low predictor. We found some strong correlations in features, but they were similar between the different URL types. Overall, we did not find super significant feature indicators of phishing or non-phishing URLs based on the dataset or major differences between the contents of either type of URL.
